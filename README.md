## What is this repository for?

This repository is for the CCNY ACM Software Competition Submission. The app is aimed at college/university students to let them check when their friends or colleagues are free at a given time period instead of texting people "Hey, are you free?"

## How do I set up this repository?

Currently, the repository is rather bare bones right now. As this project will be running on Django 1.9.2, it is currently the only dependency alongside Python 2.7.

We strongly recommend virtualenvs to isolate dependencies.

To set up the repository, type:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
